# 🧠 Data Preprocessing Templates

A complete collection of **Jupyter Notebook templates** for data preprocessing in **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Deep Learning (DL)** projects.
This repository provides clean, reusable, and well-documented notebooks for three major data types:

- 🟩 **Tabular Data (Structured)**
- 🟦 **Text Data (NLP)**
- 🟥 **Image Data (Computer Vision)**

Each notebook contains a full end-to-end data preprocessing pipeline — from loading data and performing EDA to feature engineering and model training.
